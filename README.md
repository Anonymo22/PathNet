# PAGG: Path Aggregator for Graphs Beyond Homophily
## Fig. 1 in the paper:
Fig. 1(a) stands for Homophily graph & Fig. 1(b)stands for Heterophily graph:

## Path Sampler (preprocessing)
This part can be done before training.
To generate the paths for dataset *data_name* (*e.g.* cora). In *gen.cpp*, we change the names of the input and output files to *data_name*, then compile and run *gen.cpp*. The program will generate a file containing all paths.

Compile and run *gen.cpp*  for normal datasets

```shell
g++ gen.cpp -o gen -g -Wall -O2 -mcmodel=medium
./gen
```

If a graph contains too many nodes, the file generated by the above method will be too large and occupy a large running memory. So we provide *gen_epoch.cpp* to generate corresponding paths for each epoch.

Compile and run *gen_epoch.cpp* for large datasets

```shell
g++ gen_epoch.cpp -o gen_epoch -g -Wall -O2 -mcmodel=medium
./gen_epoch
```
## Main model

### Files
'dataset.json': contains dataset splits
'dataset.py': data usage code (imported in run.py )
'run.py': main code

### model usage
```shell
python run.py 
```
Other hyperparameters can be delivered by command line arguments, such as ```-lr=0.005```. The trained model will be saved in 'saved_models' and the performance will be saved in 'results'.

### Model variants & parameters
Changing the PAGG class can deliver other variants. If you want to try other settings like path length or number of paths, you can first generate the according paths and change the hyperparameters.

## Synthetic experiments
Synthetic graph generators are used to complete the synthesis experiment. At the beginning, all nodes with odd index and even index on the graph are attached with two different features. Synthetic label generators will search all paths with length k for each node (excluding the starting node), and there will be various path patterns. The index of the most path pattern will be selected as the label of the node.

We provide a synthetic label generator for Cora and Citeseer. The two generators will get a file with the same number of lines as the number of nodes in the original network, and each line represents the label of this node in the synthetic graph.

syn_cora:
Compile and run *gen_cora_syn.cpp*

```shell
g++ gen_cora_syn.cpp -o gen_cora_syn -g -Wall -O2
./gen_cora_syn
```

syn_citeseer:
Compile and run *gen_citeseer_syn.cpp*

```shell
g++ gen_citeseer_syn.cpp -o gen_citeseer_syn -g -Wall -O2
./gen_citeseer_syn
```
